# Furniture-WebShop

This project represents a dynamic and modern solution for managing and showcasing furniture items. The backend is powered by .NET 6 and for database management is used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) . On the client side, I've utilized Angular with TypeScript. This combo ensures that our app looks nice and works well. We're building this as part of our faculty project. 
The project is host localy. I worked on the backend as well as on the frontend by myself. 

For the development of this project, we used Scrum Agile methodologies as part of our Software Development Life Cycle. 

There is a short documentation (Sechia.docx document) where you can see how app looks.
