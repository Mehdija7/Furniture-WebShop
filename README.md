# Furniture-WebShop

This project represents a dynamic and modern solution for managing and showcasing furniture items. The backend is powered by .NET 6. On the client side, I've utilized Angular with TypeScript to deliver a seamless user experience. This combo ensures that our app looks nice and works well. We're building this as part of our faculty project. 
The project is host localy. I worked on the backend as well as on the frontend by myself.

There is a short documentation (Sechia.docx document) where you can see how app looks.
